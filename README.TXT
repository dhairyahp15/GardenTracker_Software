PROJECT TITLE: Assignment 1 

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Creating and testing basic object methods and constructors, array of objects.

VERSION or DATE: 02 October 2020

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: To test all the files that required to be tested for the assignment, you should complie 
all the java files and run the GardenTracker and TestClass files to see the output and verify that all the methods 
are working properly.

AUTHORS: Dhairya Prajapati.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Assignment has been completed successfully and tested the code. Some things to let the user know, 
that after phase 3b as I changed the currentGarden plant array to the type of PlantList object which already contains 
plant array. After changing it some of the methods in the GardenTracker class such as initializeGarden and printPlantList 
will no longer be useful, but before changing our currentGarden to type PlantList I tested all the methods of 
GardenTracker class for the currentGarden plant array everything worked perfectly and was recorded in my git repo which
has been handed to you with my assignment, and all my versions of file from staring of my assignment to the end of my 
assignment has been recorded in my git repository. One more thing, that as mentioned in the assingment there are 2 files
which contains main method TestClass and GardenTracker, so I used the TestClass's main method to test my methods and 
GardenTracker's main method to actually complete Phases of the assignment and made complete user interactie type software.

Thank you.
